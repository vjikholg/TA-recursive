# Tech Annihilation - Recursion (TAR)
Uses Recoil Engine (https://github.com/beyond-all-reason/spring), fork of Spring Engine (https://springrts.com/). 

This is a WIP overhaul of popular RTS Tech Annihilation intended to be used in conjunction with Dynamic Robot Defence. The goal here is to maintain, and update legacy codebase, improve gameplay such as by porting modern UIs, GL4 shaders and similar features from BAR, and to revamp each faction, giving them more unique flavor than generic unit X or Y. Balance is mostly thrown out the window for the sake of grandiose, cool things are reenabled or added, all with modern, revamped audio so actions don't sound like putting your hand through a cheesegrater. 

## Getting Started
